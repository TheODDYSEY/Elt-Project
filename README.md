## ELT Project with Docker and PostgreSQL ##

Welcome to the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) project repository, where we explore a streamlined approach to data processing using Docker and PostgreSQL. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the project structure, deployment steps, and customization options to help you harness the power of ELT for your data engineering needs.

### Repository Structure

```

    - __pycache__/
    - elt_dag.py
- airflow.cfg
- custom_postgres/
- dbt_project.yml

### Components Overview

- **dags/**: Holds Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) definitions, facilitating workflow orchestration.
- **airflow.cfg**: Configuration file for Airflow, allowing fine-grained control over Airflow's behavior.
- **custom_postgres/**: Directory for custom PostgreSQL configurations, enabling tailored database settings.
- **dbt_project.yml**: Configuration file for dbt (data build tool), defining project-specific settings for dbt usage.
- **elt/**: Container for ELT scripts and Dockerfile, encapsulating the logic for data extraction, loading, and transformation.
- **logs/**: Storage location for Airflow logs, aiding in monitoring and debugging workflows.
- **source_db_init/**: Houses SQL script to initialize the source PostgreSQL database with sample data.
- **tests/**: Space for project tests, ensuring robustness and reliability of the ELT pipeline.
- **README.md**: Central hub for project documentation, providing guidance and instructions.
- **docker-compose.yaml**: Definition file for Docker Compose, facilitating multi-container application deployment.
- **start.sh**: Script for starting the project, streamlining the initialization process.

### Usage

#### Starting the ELT Process

To initiate the ELT process, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command launches the defined Docker containers, triggering the ELT workflow.

#### Stopping the Containers and Removing Volumes

To gracefully halt the project and clean up associated volumes, run:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### ELT Step

To execute the ELT process manually:

1. Start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

2. Once the ELT process completes, stop the containers and remove volumes:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

3. Optionally, access the destination PostgreSQL database using:

```bash
docker exec -it elt-project-destination_postgres-1 psql -U postgres
```

### Airflow Step

For Airflow integration:

1. Initialize Airflow:

```bash
docker-compose up init-airflow -d
```

2. Start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

3. Access the Airflow UI at `localhost:8080` to monitor and manage ELT workflows.

### Further Customization

- **ELT Script**: Modify `elt_script.py` in the `elt/` directory to tailor the ELT process to specific requirements.
- **Airflow DAGs**: Adjust DAG definitions in the `dags/` directory to customize workflow scheduling and dependencies.
- **Configuration Files**: Explore `docker-compose.yaml`, `airflow.cfg`, and other configuration files for fine-tuning project settings.

This ELT project offers a flexible and scalable solution for handling data processing tasks, providing a solid foundation for building robust data pipelines. Dive in, explore, and adapt it to suit your data engineering needs!
